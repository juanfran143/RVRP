This project aims to solve the Rich Vehicle Routing Problem. 

The objective is to arrive at a problem as rich as the user indicates. Metaheuristic algorithms will be used to solve it, as well as leanrheuristic for those problems that are dynamic and symheuristic if the problem contains stochastic variables.
